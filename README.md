# small-ebird-scripts
Little scripts that split something off or summarize the big EBD download.

1. Duplicate-locID-checker2 - searches for point locations in eBird that map to more than one LocID (which can result in point locations not showing on the map). 

2. Exports-checklists-with-no-codes - This script searches for checklists with no codes on them and outputs all observtions from those checklists.

3. one-row-per-speices-per-block - This cuts the EBD down to 1 row for each unique coded species per block.

4. species-per-checklist - returns the number of species on each checklist.

5. split-by-county - Splits the download into separate files by county (could be modified to do a file per species, or any other column).

6. summing-observer-time - A pivot-table like script that sums birding time by observer.

7. unique-locations - This calculates the number of unique locations in the file.
